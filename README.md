# ttd-kata-javascript-promise
Create an implementation of a JavaScript promise as part of a TTD kata

##TODO
Test 4 requires too much coding (e.g. creation of functions, addition of async behavior, etc). Becomes too heavy to watch if this kata used for a live code. Needs broken down into smaller requirement goals.
